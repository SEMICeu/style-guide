<h2 id="sec:what-is-a-conceptual-model"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-conceptual-model"></a>What is a conceptual model?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A <strong><em>conceptual model</em></strong>, also referred to as <strong><em>conceptual model specification</em></strong>, is an abstract representation of a system and comprises well-defined concepts, their qualities or attributes, and their relationships to other concepts. A system is a group of interacting or interrelated
elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [<a href="references.html#ref:skos" class="xref page">skos</a>]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes. The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts. Most commonly, these are association and generalisation relations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, the conceptual model can be materialised in a graphical representation facilitating knowledge elicitation, organisation and interaction with domain experts. This is relevant because interactions and discussions within a Working Group for a data specification are often driven by a graphical representation. However, the need for a conceptual model and a visual representation shall not be conflated. Thus, we keep clear separation of concerns, which is addressed in detailed in the next section [<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:separation-of-concerns-and-transformation" class="xref page">Separation of concerns in SEMIC</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no perfect candidate for representing the conceptual model. And, although not without limitations, risks for misunderstandings and mis-interpretations, we choose (a subset of) UML language [<a href="references.html#ref:epo-cm2owl" class="xref page">epo-cm2owl</a>] as most appropriate and instrumental in addressing (a) the concern for having a conceptual model established and (b) the concern for providing a graphical representation. The UML appropriateness has been acknowledged based on a longstanding experience and practices. An entire section of this style guide is dedicated to (UML) conceptual model [<a href="gc-conceptual-model-conventions.html" class="xref page">see Conceptual model conventions</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The subset of the UML language considered in this style guide is comprised (but not limited to) in the following set of UML elements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Attribute</p>
</li>
<li>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>

<p>For visual representation only UML Class Diagrams are considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> UML will be the recommended language for defining the conceptual models until a better and more appropriate alternative with robust tool support is developed, that is also addressing the SEMIC methods and practices [<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html" class="xref page">see Architectural clarification</a>].</p>

<h2 id="sec:what-is-an-ontology"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-an-ontology"></a>What is an ontology?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
An <strong><em>ontology</em></strong>, also referred to as <strong><em>ontology specification</em></strong>, is a a formal specification describing the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) [<a href="references.html#ref:gruber93" class="xref page">gruber93</a>]. It encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse [<a href="references.html#ref:wiki-onto" class="xref page">wiki-onto</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
The ontology constitutes the formal (machine-readable) definition of concepts. Although the languages for expressing ontologies vary in expressivity, we shall keep it light and simple, from the formal point of view, with minimal detail and level of expressivity [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r2" class="xref page">SC-R2</a>]. Backer &amp; Sutton explain well how lightweight semantics supports interoperability and reuse [<a href="references.html#ref:baker15" class="xref page">baker15</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the SEMIC context, we only consider <em>lightweight ontologies</em> [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r2" class="xref page">defined in rule SC-R2</a>]. Therefore, even if this aspect is not emphasised as "lightweight ontology", it is implicitly meant even when simple "ontology" reference is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We assume that the ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r1" class="xref page">SC-R1</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties, datatypes and controlled lists. Each construct is established by assigning a URI and decorating it with human-readable labels and descriptions, and constitutes the mechanism to establish common references for humans and machines.</p>

<h2 id="sec:what-is-a-data-shape-contraint"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-data-shape-contraint"></a>What is a data shape specification?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A <strong><em>data shape specification</em></strong>, also referred to as <strong><em>data shape constraint specification</em></strong>, or simply as <strong><em>data shape constraint</em></strong> or <strong><em>data shape</em></strong>, provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph.
We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications simply as "data shapes", but occasionally also as "data shape constraints" or "data shape specifications".</p>

<h2 id="sec:what-is-a-specification-document"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-specification-document"></a>What is a data specification document?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A <strong><em>data specification document</em></strong>, also referred to as <strong><em>specification document</em></strong>, is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape, or a combination of both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
A data specification document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to understand (a)
how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain, and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose.
It is to serve as technical documentation for anyone interested in using (e.g. adopting or extending) a semantic data specification (see [<a href="#sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification">What is a semantic data specification?</a>]).
We assume that the data specification documents are published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification
[<a href="references.html#ref:cpv" class="xref page">cpv</a>] or the CPSV-AP specification [<a href="references.html#ref:cpsv-ap" class="xref page">cpsv-ap</a>].</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A <strong><em>data specification artefact</em></strong>, often referred to as <strong><em>specification artefact</em></strong> or simply <strong><em>artefact</em></strong>, is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a concrete representation that is appropriate for addressing
one or more concerns (e.g. use cases, requirements).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents.
For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see the section

<h2 id="sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification"></a>What is a semantic data specification?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A <strong><em>semantic data specification</em></strong> , often called simply <strong><em>data specification</em></strong>, is a union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability
scope and use-cases. A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually)
accompanied by a human-readable data specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
One general categorisation of semantic data specifications is along the reuse axis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some semantic data specifications are built with the intent that the terms of the conceptual model can be used in as much as possible contexts. Typically, it is possible to use the terms independently of each other. In this case, the definitions of the terms are usually very broad and abstract, and only the bare minimum of (usage) constraints are expressed. Often, the terms are presented as a list to the reader, with identifiers for each term in the same namespace. Those semantic data specifications are usually denoted with terms such as vocabularies or terminology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other side of the spectrum are the data specifications that precisely encode the semantics of the conceptual model that is being used in a single data exchange context, implemented in software or API. They usually have a strong connection with technical data representations (see section on [<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:technical-concerns-and-artefacts" class="xref page">Technical artefacts and concerns</a>]) and documentations such as XSD schema, OpenAPI specifications, etc. Conceptual models for this purpose will contain precise constraints, technical datatypes, the code-lists that are being used, refer to implementation decisions, etc. Semantic data specifications that are created for that purpose are denoted with Implementation Models. As that name indicate, their objective is to encode the conceptual model of an implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Between those two extremes, i.e. contextfree reuse (vocabularies) and unique usage context (Implementation Models), there are semantic data specifications that aim to capture the conceptual model for a broad, yet well-defined, usage context. Typically, these data specifications do not intend to introduce new terms in the conceptual model, but will exploit terms from other semantic data specifications. These exploited terms are augmented with additional usage constraints making the terms more fit for purpose.  These semantic data specifications are often denoted with terms such as Application Profiles or Profiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Readers should understand that the usage relationships between semantic data specifications form a complex network. An attempt to provide a structured view on this network was initiated in the draft W3C Profile Guide [<a href="references.html#ref:profile-guide" class="xref page">profile-guide</a>]. Also, the Application Profiles do not necessarily have to address all the technical needs related to an implemented system. Distinction between technical and semantic interoperability layers is attempted in <a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:technical-concerns-and-artefacts" class="xref page">this section</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This categorisation along the reuse axis indicates the importance of expressing the interoperability scope for semantic data specifications. However, due to the absence of widely accepted definitions for those categories, outlining the exact <strong><em>Do</em></strong>s and <strong><em>Don&#8217;t</em></strong>s (for each category), may result to different expectations for each category. This style guide is a document that defines the commonly accepted and applied rules for SEMIC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the SEMIC context, two types of semantic data specifications are considered: [<a href="#sec:what-is-a-cv-specification">Core Vocabulary</a>] and [<a href="#sec:what-is-an-ap-specification">Application Profile</a>]. Semantic data specifications of the third category, Implementation Models, are not part of the activities of SEMIC. Nevertheless, their existence, is taken into account when building the Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally, this document will refer to semantic data specifications shortly as "data specifications". With a similar meaning, the term "semantic asset" is used in the literature (e.g. ADMS [<a href="references.html#ref:adms" class="xref page">adms</a>]). However, in our understanding, the term "semantic asset" is broader than "data specification" and includes controlled vocabularies and possibly other types of assets.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="sec:what-is-a-cv-specification"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-cv-specification"></a>What is a Core Vocabulary (CV) specification?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable and extensible data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an
entity in a context-neutral fashion. Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Broad context</strong> (on vocabularies)<br>
On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as "terms") used to describe and represent
an area of concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterise possible
relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several
thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only) [<a href="references.html#ref:vocab" class="xref page">vocab</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no clear division between what is referred to as "vocabulary" and "ontology". The trend is to use the word "ontology"
for a more complex and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas "vocabulary" is used when such strict formalism is not
necessarily used or used only in a very loose sense [<a href="references.html#ref:vocab" class="xref page">vocab</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>SEMIC context</strong> (on Core Vocabularies)<br>
Formally, a Core Vocabulary encompasses a lightweight ontology, and, optionally, a (permissive) data shape specification, and it
is expressed in a condensed, comprehensive data specification document.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
An Application Profile is a data specification aimed to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined  application context. It re-uses
concepts from one or more semantic data specifications, while adding more specificity, by identifying mandatory, recommended, and
optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and providing recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used

<p><strong>SEMIC context</strong><br>
In SEMIC, Application Profiles encompass an ontology, which is largely composed of importing the reused ontologies, complemented
with an appropriate data shape specification. Terms that are introduced because of the Application Profile needs are, by preference,
added to existing Core Vocabularies. If this is not possible, an Application Profile-specific Vocabulary is created.</p>

<p>The data specification document of an Application Profile is elaborated. It provides the application scope and context, and
documents the ontology and the data shapes through the conceptual model. It also provides additional information that stimulates
the adoption and correct usage of the AP in implementations.</p>
