# Self-assessment & Validation

Wondering how well your own semantic data specifications adhere to the rules listed in the Style Guide? The [Interoperability Test Bed](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed) offers the SEMIC Style Guide Validator as a service. The SEMIC Style Guide Validator allows the user to upload a model in either UML (XMI), SHACL or OWL format and validate it against the rules expressed in the Style Guide.
The Style Guide Validator is available in the following formats:
- [UML Style Guide Validator (Web Service)](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/model2owl/upload)
- [SCHALC/OWL Style Guide Validator (Web Service)](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/semicstyleguide/upload)
- [REST API Style Guide Validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/swagger-ui/index.html)
- [SOAP API Style Guide Validator](https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/soap/semicstyleguide/validation?wsdl)

Documentation on the Style Guide validator can be found on [Joinup](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperability-test-bed-repository/solution/interoperability-test-bed/news/new-semic-style-guide-validator-available) or on the respective pages on the ITB.
